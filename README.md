# odin-recipes

This is a learning project to build a small recipe website using HTML, and eventually to style it with CSS. I'm going to make a few basic pages using HTML, link to a few other basic pages, and add some basic elements (images, unordered and ordered lists, and links) that all rely on understanding my file structure. I'm also going to be tracking those changes with git.
